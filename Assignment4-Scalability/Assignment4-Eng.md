# Lab 4

Frequent situation when the customer persistently asks to reduce the price. Or, even worse, ask to cut the budget in the middle of project. For such cases, it is worth to put an offer "with an extra margin".

So imagine the situation. Suppose you have a project described in PM Lab1, and the customer requests to reduce the total development costs by half. For some reason, it is impossible to refuse. Reducing the quality of work by hiring cheaper, but less qualified professionals is also impossible. It is necessary to reduce the functionality, reduce the scale of the project.

Describe what reductions in the scale of your project will allow you to reduce initial budget in 2 (or around it) times.
