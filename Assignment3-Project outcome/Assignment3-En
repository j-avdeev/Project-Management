One of the most critical issues in the project idea developing are issues related to the project budget (Assignment1).
Answer these questions:

1. What is the final product of the project - method, technology, "semi-finished product", data/product?

2. Whom do you consider the target audience, the consumer of the product?

3. What the market volume, I mean, how much money does the target audience spend per year now, what trends, how much will it spend in 5 years (at least approximately)?
If the project creates a new market by its appearance, then indicate new market expected volume.
Specify on the basis of what data the volume was counted.

4. What are the competitors at the moment? If there is, then what is your solution better?

5. Is there already a consumer who needs the results of your project and, at least verbally, promised that he will use your solution?
How are you going to find customers?
